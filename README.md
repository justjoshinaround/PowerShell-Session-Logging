Open PowerShell.
Run the code in "Create Profile" to, you guessed it, either create 
said profile or to ensure it already exists.

After doing that, open "Enable Logging" and alter the file paths on
lines 3, 6, and 7 as-needed and then run it.

There should now be a folder at the given location that will log
all PowerShell sessions in their entirety.
